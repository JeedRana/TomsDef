    <h3>Rules of Billiards:</h3>
    <ol>
        <dl>
            <dt><b>1.1 Player's Responsibility:</b></dt>
                <dd>It is the player's responsibility to be aware of all rules, regulations and schedules applying to
                    competition.</dd>
            <dt><b>1.2 Lagging to Determine Order of Play:</b></dt>
                <dd>The lag is the first shot of the match and determines order of play. The player who wins the
                    lag chooses who will shoot first.</dd>
            <dt><b>1.3 Player's Use of Equipment:</b></dt>
                <dd>The equipment must meet existing WPA equipment specifications. In general, players are not
                    permitted to introduce novel equipment into the game. </dd>
            <dt><b>1.4 Spotting Balls:</b></dt>
                <dd>Balls are spotted (returned to play on the table) by placing them on the long string (long axis
                    of the table) as close as possible to the foot spot and between the foot spot and the foot rail,
                    without moving any interfering ball. </dd>
            <dt><b>1.5 Cue Ball in Hand:</b></dt>
                <dd>When the cue ball is in hand, the shooter may place the cue ball anywhere on the playing
                    surface (see 8.1 Parts of the Table) and may continue to move the cue ball until he executes a
                    shot. (See definition 8.2 Shot.)</dd>
            <dt><b>1.6 Standard Call Shot:</b></dt>
                <dd>In games in which the shooter is required to call shots, the intended ball and pocket must be
                    indicated for each shot if they are not obvious.</dd>
            <dt><b>1.7 Balls Settling:</b></dt>
                <dd>A ball may settle slightly after it appears to have stopped, possibly due to slight imperfections
                    in the ball or the table.</dd>
